The purpose of this demo is to explore the main concepts of Composable Architecture (TCA). What I wanted to do is something beyond a counter demo because I think there are a lot of important use cases and apps with just one screen that don't reflect a real-world application.
In another hand, I didn't want to build something too complex because would be hard to understand for beginners.
